# Dooku

#Version
v0.2

##Motivation
Dooku is a python app that converts 2x2 or 2x1 slides PDFs into 1x1 slide PDFs.
It was created in response to an irrational "Compilers" teacher, who refuses to 
upload his lectures slides in a 1x1 format.

##To-Do
*Add 3x1 support. [Easy]
*Use less libraries. [Medium ~ Requires time to investigate]
*Don't write in the FS, use objects instead. [Medium ~ Related to the previous one]
*Make the app smart so it can decide the input format (2x2, 2x1, 3x1, etc...). [Hard ~ openCV or some Computer Vision needed]
